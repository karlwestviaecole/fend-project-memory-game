# Memory Game Project

## About

This project was developed as a submission for the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program at [Udacity](https://udacity.com). This project is not maintained.

## Usage

There are no dependencies for this project. Just open __index.html__ in your browser and you're ready to play! The game needs an internet connection to fetch some fonts and styles.

## How the game works

This is a traditional memory game for your browser.

Click a card to flip it, then click on another to see if they match. If they match, they'll stay open, but if not, they will close.

You finish the game by matching all the cards.

If you finish the game in 10 moves, you'll earn 5 stars. 15 moves is 4 stars, 20 is 3 stars, 25 is 2 stars and more than 25 moves will give you 1 star.

You can restart the game any time you want!
